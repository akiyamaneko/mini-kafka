Trying to implement basic working version of Kafka to understand it.

## What to implement :
- [ ] Public/Subscribe system like in Kafka
- [ ] Create topics and publish messages to that topic and consume the messages
- [ ] Zookeeper to monitor brokers,topics and consumers
- [ ] Handle single point of failure
